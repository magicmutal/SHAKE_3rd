Welcome to Brain Signal Processing Laboratory !!

We are investigating brain functions measured by various neuroimaging modalities such as functional MRI (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) toward potential applications such as brain health care systems including brain-computer interface (BCI) and brain-machine interface (BMI) to enhance human performance.
